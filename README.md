That Bitch Loading Screen Fix by nixkiez:

Installation:
The installation is very simple, go to your bully directory, then go to scripts and take scripts.img and scripts.dir from the zip file and replace them. If you are a modder and want to use this with mods, the compressed lua file is included aswell (1_08.lur) I am not sure if it is compatible with other mods, but i assume so, but, testing is a thing for a reason.

I reccommend you make a backup of your scripts folder, just in case the mod causes some issues im not aware of.
